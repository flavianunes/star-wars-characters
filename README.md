## About this project

## Improvement opportunities

1. The people endpoint could filter results based on homeworld. This would be more performant than filtering on the client-side or requesting from the `residents`array (the approach)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
